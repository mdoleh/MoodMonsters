Unity3d game to teach children about emotions

The game presents a set of different scenarios to represent 1 of 4 emotions. Each scenario is presented and asks the player a series of questions regarding what emotion the character in the scene is showing as well as what physical responses does one present when exhibiting that emotion. Finally, it will ask what the character should do in that scenario. Getting the answers correct will reward the player with coins as well as a couple mini games including a simple catching eggs mini game and puzzle mini game where the player will snap a photo of himself/herself and reassemble the picture after it is scrambled. The questions asked of the player (presumably a child between ages 4 & 6) are designed to teach how to problem solve these common emotions.

There are also some scenarios where the player's parent can be involved. Questions are asked of the parent which are aimed to teach common techniques in helping children handle their feelings.
